In this project, I built tic-tac-toe using JS, as well as some html and css for visuals.

During the course of this small project, I've gotten significantly more comfortable using DOM manipulation. Using templates in my html, swapping out entire div's, chaining buttons and forms. All in all, I feel like I have gained quite a lot from completing this. The visual aspect is more than a bit lackluster, but I may remedy that in the future. CSS is not my strong suite.
